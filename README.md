# Ostia

This is going to be a self-hosted music streaming service.  For now, it's a huge
work in progress, code changes rapidly and commit history isn't the prettiest.
Much of the code was written in one night, so it isn't pretty either.  But hey,
it already plays songs!

Of course, I'm not responsible for any illegal use.  Use common sense.

## Architecture

This is what we have now. Again, we're moving fast and breaking things, so
expect change.

The server part is a Symfony 5 application using Twig templates.  React is used
to add dynamic behavior to the prerendered pages.  For example, the track list
is first rendered server-side in
[tracks.html.twig](https://github.com/logarytm/ostia/blob/master/templates/library/tracks.html.twig)
and then rerendered again when JS is ready, via the
[TrackListView](https://github.com/logarytm/ostia/blob/master/assets/tracks/TrackListView.tsx)
component, using the track list provided by the server (no extra requests
needed). This creates some code duplication but drastically improves both real
and perceived performance.  Progressive Enhancement FTW!

In the future, we may still need something along the lines of
[pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) so that music keeps playing while
the user navigates to a different page.

## How to run it

You need to have `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` installed in your PATH.

First, create an `.env.local` file and set a proper `DATABASE_URL` (template is
in `.env`).

```sh
$ composer install
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ mkdir -p var/uploads/temporary
$ bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
$ bin/server
# Go to http://localhost:8000/register to create an account
```

`bin/server` is a wrapper for PHP's builin webserver.  It's not mandatory to use
it â€” it's just for convenience.  You can use `npm run dev-server` instead of
`npm run build` if you wish to work on the frontend.
